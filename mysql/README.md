## Creating the MySQL DB

Step 1: Run the `setup.sh` command for env variables.
```sh -x ./setup.sh```

Step 2: Run the `sh -x ./startup.sh` command to start up the DB. 
    If this command does not work, try deleting the contents of data directory.
    For debugging, run the command written there. You will have more detailed info. 

You don't have to do anything else once you run these commands.
